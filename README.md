## Description
For this project, I used html and css to revise prewritten code. I was able to add alt tags to images, reduce redundancies in the css file, and neaten up the rest of the code.  [Here](https://reedsantos.github.io/Code-refactor/) is the deployed link.

            
## Usage
When a user opens this app then they are presented with a neat professional website.
